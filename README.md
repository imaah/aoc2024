# Advent Of Code 2024

[Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) using gleam.

## Prerequisites

- Gleam: [installation](https://gleam.run/getting-started/installing/)

And that's it :)

## How to run the solvers ?

Let's say that you want to solve day 1, you'll first need to download your inputs. And execute this command : 

```sh
gleam run -m day01/solver <path to your input file>
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why Gleam?

Because why not...

### Why is your code bad?

Because of 3 reasons:
1. I don't know functional programming.
2. The first line of gleam I wrote was on 01/12/2024.
3. I might just be bad at coding
